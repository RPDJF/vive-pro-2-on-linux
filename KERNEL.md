# Linux with VIVE Pro 2 patches

Kernel patches created by [CertainLach](https://github.com/CertainLach/VivePro2-Linux-Driver/).

**NOTE:** The custom kernel is only designed to be installed on Arch Linux. \
If you are on another distribution, will have to find out how to patch and compile a kernel on it (see CertainLach's repository). \
I personally do not recommend using anything else than a bleeding edge distro for this at the moment. \
See Kernel Patches section below for the patches used in this guide.

### Enter the kernel directory
- `cd kernel/`

### Build and install the patched kernel
- Kernel version: `6.13.8-arch1-1`

#### Import GPG keys
- `for key in ./keys/pgp/*.asc; do gpg --import $key; done`

#### Build the custom kernel
- `export MAKEFLAGS="-j $(nproc)"`
- `makepkg -sc`

#### Install the custom kernel and update the bootloader (e.g. GRUB)
- `makepkg -si`
- `sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg`

### Reboot and ensure you've booted with the patched kernel
- `uname -r` should print `6.x.x-arch1-1-vivepro2`
- You can now proceed with setting up SteamVR and/or the FOSS VR alternatives.
